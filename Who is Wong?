Hello!

My name is Anthony Wong, and I'm a self-taught IT enthusiast who has been interested in technology since childhood,
aspiring to find out how computers really work behind the scenes.

I started off with tutorials involving C++ and Python, grasping their purposes. Eventually, I stumbled across game development
and aimed to reach a level of professionalism where I could smoothly create my own video games, with the goal of discovering
bugs, understanding where they come from, why they occur, and how to patch them. However, as time passed by, I realized
IT/Cybersecurity was a better fit for my ambitions, as it allows me to properly execute my goals in a more practical way.

In 2023, I attended a cybersecurity boot camp, which boosted my foundational skills for both Red and Blue teaming. Shortly
after, I pursued and obtained the CompTIA Security+ certification.

Now, I'm focused on expanding my knowledge using as many online resources as possible to finally reach my ultimate goal of landing a role in tech!


During my free time, I often enjoy playing the piano and going walks in nature ðŸŽ¹ ðŸŒ±
